Building GenSim:

Note: The scripts/build-gensim.sh file can be used to set up a build 
      environment and build gensim. If you use that script, you don't
      need to follow the instructions here.

 1. Download and built ANTLR - this can be accomplished using the 
    scripts/get-and-build-antlr.sh script, or performed manually. The
    required ANTLR version is 3.4c. The ANTLR JAR file and C runtime
    are required. The script will place the ANTLR JAR file in antlr/jar
    and the compiled ANTLR C Runtime in antlr/runtime/install
 
 2. Use autoreconf to generate the configure script.
 3. Run the configure script, using --with-antlr and --with-antlrjar to
    provide the paths to your ANTLR runtime installation and ANTLR JAR
    file.
    
    e.g.:
    $ ./configure --with-antlr=/path/to/antlr/install --with-antlrjar=/path/to/antlr7.jar
    
 4. Run 'make' to build Gensim. The '-j' flag can be used to run a 
    parallel build, e.g.
    $ make -j4
    Will run 4 concurrent compilation workers. Additionally, the OPT
    flag can be provided to build with optimisations enabled:
    $ make -j4 OPT=1


Testing GenSim
GenSim currently doesn't have many tests. If you want to run what tests
there are you can run 'make tests' in the GenSim directory. The tests
use google-test, which is checked out and built locally, in accordance
with Google's guidelines. This means that you will need to have cmake 
installed in order to build the tests.
