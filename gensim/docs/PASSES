1.0 Optimisation Passes
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Optimisation passes should leave the SSA in a consistent state. This
means that:
 - There should be no empty blocks
 - Each block should have exactly one control flow statement, at the end
 - Statements should not refer to statements in other blocks (except
   for Phi statements)
