1.0 The Gensim Compiler
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Gensim Compiler reads in Gensim ADL models, performs some 
processing, and outputs (generally) C++ source code. 

A Gensim model consists of several main components:
1. The System description, which contains information on register banks,
   features, etc.
2. The Syntactic description, which specifies how instructions are
   encoded
3. The Semantic description, which specifies how instructions are 
   executed.

Each of these components is processed by a different part of the 
toolchain. The most complex processing is performed on the Semantic
component (which is also usually the largest component).


If you are interested in writing a model or using gensim, you should
read the documentation in the models directory. The documentation in
this directory is more intended for developers.
