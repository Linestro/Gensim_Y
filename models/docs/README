3.0 Gensim Models
------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Gensim model consists of several main components:
1. The System description, which contains information on register banks,
   features, etc.
2. The Syntactic description, which specifies how instructions are
   encoded
3. The Semantic description, which specifies how instructions are 
   executed.

The System description also serves as a top-level file for the rest of
the model. At least one syntactic description file and semantic 
description file exist for each instruction set supported by the 
architecture.
