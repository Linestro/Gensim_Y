3.2 The Syntactic Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Syntactic description specifies how instructions are encoded in
the target instruction set. Instruction formats are described using
a 'printf string' style. This part of the description is very similar
to ArchC, although some additional information is also required 
relating to how jumps should be handled.
