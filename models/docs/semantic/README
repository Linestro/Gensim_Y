3.3 The Semantic Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Semantic description is generally the largest and most complex
part of the model, and describes how instructions within the model 
should behave i.e., what are their effects.

Semantic descriptions are written in a C-like language called GenC.
GenC has no pointer types, and no user-defined structured types. A 
large number of intrinsic functions are defined in order to manipulate
the state of the simulated machine (i.e., read/write registers and 
memory) and to perform utility operations.
