3.1 The System Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The System description language is based on a subset of ArchC (although
Gensim and ArchC models are not intercompatible). The System description
contains top-level information about the architecture being modelled,
such as the layout of the register file, the features available, and
the instruction sets supported.
