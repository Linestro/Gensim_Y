			 *
			 * IT Blocks cause us a lot of issues in full system simulation. We want to
			 * avoid really tracking the ITSTATE bits because this would be very
			 * inefficient. We need to be especially careful with the following cases:
			 *  - IT block which spans a page boundary, where accessing the second page
			 *    causes an Instruction Abort
			 *  - IT block which spans two pages, and an interrupt occurs between
			 *    finishing the block on one page and starting the block on the next
			 *  - IT block which contains a load instruction, where the load instruction
			 *    causes a Data Abort and there are more predicated instructions after
			 *    the load.
			 *  - IT block which contains a software interrupt instruction and there
			 *    are more predicated instructions after the SWI
			 *
			 * The Decode Context class is designed to address this in a reasonably
			 * generic manner - the class internally keeps track of the ITSTATE field,
			 * and writes it back to the CPU after decoding each instruction. This
			 * ensures that page boundary issues are correctly handled.
			 *
			 * This
			 * could potentially be extended to handle (straightforward) branch delay
			 * effects by having the class track end-of-basic-block conditions. This
			 * could also potentially be extended to handle e.g. x86 instruction
			 * prefixes.
