		 * This event system is designed to solve several of the problems of
		 * the previous PubSub system, especially in a multithreaded context.
		 *
		 * The previous system has two main problems:
		 *  - Events might be received and processed by a subscriber while it
		 *    is in an indeterminate state (e.g., flushing decode cache while
		 *    using an instruction in said cache)
		 *  - Events cannot be scoped and so an event intended to affect one
		 *    thread actually affect all threads.
		 *
		 * This system is intended to solve these problems by introducing a
		 * concept of the event distributor:
		 *  1. An event distributor D is created
		 *  2. An event consumer C is created, and registered with D
		 *  3. An event producer P is created
		 *  4. P produces an event E, which C is interested in
		 *  5. The event E is placed into a buffer in D
		 *  6. D waits until it is in a safe state
		 *  7. D distributes E to C
		 *  8. C receives the event and acts on it
		 *
		 * Further, the producer of an event could require receipts, to ensure
		 * that all possible consumers of events receive and act before
		 * the producer returns/continues processing
		 *
		 *
		 *
