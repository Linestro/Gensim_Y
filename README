0.0 The Gensim Toolset
------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.1 Get Started

0.1.0 Install dependencies

GenSim is developed primarily on Fedora 26, and tested mainly on Fedora 
26 and 27, Debian 9.3 (Stretch), Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04, and ArchLinux. 

Generally the following dependencies are required:

autoconf
antlr3-C-devel
automake
cmake 
findutils
gcc
java 1.8.0
make
ncurses-devel
wget
zlib-devel

The exact package names will vary depend on which Linux distribution 
you're using. 

0.1.1 Building the Toolset

You probably just want to know how to get everything compiled! The 
default configuration of Gensim and Archsim have very few dependencies, 
so you should be able to install those dependencies, type 'make', press 
return, and have everything compile.

$ make
... sometime later ...

$ # all done!

The build results can then be found in build/dist/bin and 
build/dist/lib.

If you want to build the system with optimisation enabled (which is 
recommended if you want to use it to perform simulations), then you
can build in release mode:

$ make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE
... some longer time later ...

... etc ...


0.1.2 Running a simulation

A script is provided to easily run an ARMv7-A simulation:

$ echo 'int main(int argc, char **argv) { printf("Hello world!\n"); return 0; }' > hello.c
$ arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi-gcc hello.c -static -o hello-arm
$ build/dist/bin/archsim-armv7a-user hello-arm
Hello world!


It is generally recommended to statically compile applications which you
intend to simulate. Dynamically linked applications are supported but
this requires more in-depth setup.


0.2 Introduction

Gensim is an ADL toolset designed around developing high performance
simulation tools. Often, when developing a simulator, an ad-hoc approach
is taken, meaning that developing a simulator requires deep knowledge
of the architecture under simulation, and of simulation technologies in
general. ADLs (Architecture Description Languages) such as Gensim can
be used to remove this second requirement.

The Gensim Toolset is structured as follows:
 1. The Gensim Compiler can be used to compile and analyse Models
 2. The Archsim Simulator can be used to simulate systems using those
    models.
 3. Several Models are provided

Documentation for each part of the Toolset can be found in the 
corresponding directory.
